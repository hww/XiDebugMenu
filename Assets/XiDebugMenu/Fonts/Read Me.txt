Envy Code R (coding font) preview #7.2
======================================
Envy Code R is a fully-scalable monospaced font designed for programming and command prompts.

There are three variants including in the archive - Regular, Bold and Italic.  A large number of additional symbols outside the ASCII range and provided which covers most of the Windows/ISO 1252 codepage, MacOS Roman and a number of other Central European pages.

This archive also contains a folder named 'Visual Studio Italics-as-bold' which contains the Regular and Italic fonts again with an alternate name of 'Envy Code R VS' and with the Italic variant set to identify itself as bold.  This allows you to utilise italics within Visual Studio's syntax highlighter by choosing bold everywhere you want italics - great for comments or strings!

If you wish to use Envy Code R as a font for your Windows Command Prompt run the included .reg registry file and reboot, then choose Properties from the Command Prompt to set it.
